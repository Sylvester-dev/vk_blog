excerpt: New to Flutter let's see what are the advantages of using flutter for your development.

### What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Why use Flutter?

Flutter became the most requested cross-platform technology on Stack Overflow. The reason is a single code base. It is easier to maintain: artifacts are centralized, there is no duplication of logic and edits of the same bugs for each platform. And people need less to support and create it — there is no need to maintain two native developers.

### Benefits of using Flutter

Flutter has a number of advantages over its competitors. These benefits are inherent in the programming language and a set of development tools that enable Flutter to resolve problems and disadvantages that other technologies cannot handle.

**Pros of Flutter:**
- Dart
- Growing popularity
- High performance
- Fast development speed
- One for All
- Powerful and Growing community

#### Let’s discuss these advantages in detail :

#### Dart

Dart is really easy to start and learn.Dart has a clean and incredibly powerful syntax that sets ideal conditions for creating a clear architecture and design of the application, not to mention ensuring coherence of programmers working together, durability, ease of maintenance, bringing to common standards, and much more than most other tools for cross-platform development.  For those who have already worked with popular languages such as C #, Java, and Type Script, it's easy to switch to Dart and begin using it immediately.

#### Growing Popularity

Flutter has outperformed React Native in both GitHub and Stack Overflow. Here you get a powerful supply of resources for training, more qualified developers who are ready to work on your app. And all this in the conditions of the rapid growth of the technology itself, which is rapidly developing and does not lose its relevance longer than those technologies that for many years basically remained at their previous level (for example, React Native).

#### Fast Development Speed

The Hot Reload feature is the cornerstone of Flutter. The alterations that are introduced to the source code will be immediately reflected in the running application without recompiling the source code or restarting. That means that the developers can see the changes made in the code straight away in the application. This increases the development speed significantly and depending on the complexity of the project allows saving from 20 tо 50% of time spent, which can be devoted to the development of other useful functions.

#### High Performance

Flutter apps are compiled into machine code using the graphics and visualization engine built into C/C++, so applications are very fast and high-performance. They are capable of stably delivering 60 frames per second on most devices and up to 120 frames per second on devices supporting Flutter.

#### One for All

One of the major advantages of Flutter is the ability for an app to be launched on a website using the code written for mobile devices. Since the release of a stable version, Flutter can provide a fully operating and ready-to-use web version. With Flutter Web you can run your applications in a browser without modifying the source code. So now Flutter developers have the opportunity to create applications, which can operate without any changes in the Dart programming language code for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Web browser). And that is what really makes Flutter a full-fledged cross-platform development tool.

#### Powerful and Growing Community

Taking into account the statistics and reviews of developers over the past 2 years, when Flutter gained its popularity, we can see that there are a lot of engineers who want to switch to this technology, especially among those who were writing the code separately for Android and IOS. The main reason why Flutter wasn’t popular for a while is that people were waiting for a stable version, and since a new Flutter version was released, which promises endless opportunities on number of platforms, a great peak is guaranteed in the near future.


#### Some Facts
- “Flutter has 119k GitHub Stars, while React Native has 95k as of April 2021."
